# @tenderly/hardhat-integration

## 1.1.0-beta.2

### Minor Changes

- Implemented private and public ABI verification for Lens Testnet

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies []:
  - @tenderly/api-client@1.1.0-beta.4

## 1.0.3-beta.1

### Patch Changes

- Implement automatic verification for proxies via the `@openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades` library for `@tenderly/hardhat-tenderly@^1.0.0`.

  Added examples in `ethers-v5` directory to show how this automatic verification of proxies works.

  Removed the need to call `tdly.setup()` function in `hardhat.config.ts` file.
  From now, itâ€™s enough to call `import "@tenderly/hardhat-tenderly";` after importing `hardhat-ethers` and `hardhat-upgrades`.

  Modified `examples/` to not use the `tdly.setup()` function.

  Fixed the error that has been showing during populating the networks step.
