### Minor Changes

- [#169](https://github.com/Tenderly/hardhat-tenderly/pull/169) [`a863634`](https://github.com/Tenderly/hardhat-tenderly/commit/a863634a36510f9ea91c8e9e31453f04c16ca8bf) Thanks [@dule-git](https://github.com/dule-git)! - Enable multiple tenderly networks in hardhat.config.ts

  From now on, you can put multiple networks in your `hardhat.config.ts` file in the `networks` property without the need name the network `tenderly` or `devnet`.

  Just put:

  ```ts
  networks: {
    my_tenderly_network_1: {
      url: "https://rpc.tenderly.co/fork/<forkId>",
    },
    my_tenderly_network_2: {
      url: "https://rpc.tenderly.co/fork/<forkId>",
    },
  }
  ```

  After that you can do:

  ```bash
  npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network my_tenderly_network_1
  ```

### Minor Changes

- [#164](https://github.com/Tenderly/hardhat-tenderly/pull/164) [`02952c4`](https://github.com/Tenderly/hardhat-tenderly/commit/02952c4b59f4b332e5742deb6251d9a282fbfa34) Thanks [@dule-git](https://github.com/dule-git)! - # Major `@tenderly/hardhat-tenderly` update!

  From now on, `@tenderly/hardhat-tenderly` can work with `ethers-v6` and `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers@3.0.0` packages.

  This update is needed since there are new ways to deploy and wait for the deployed contract.

  Basically, our automatic verification overrides the `ethers` property of the `HardhatRuntimeEnvironment` and adds custom logic for verification to it.

  So now, we had to override the `ethers.deployContract` method to return our own `TdlyContract` which wrapped the `ethers.Contract` and its `waitForDeployment()` method.

  # Migrating from `ethers-v5` and `@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers`

  Everything pretty much stays the same, except different names are involved.

  `Contract.deploy()` becomes `ethers.deployContract('contract')`

  `contract.deployed()` becomes `contract.waitForDeployment()`

  You can check out our updated [examples/contract-verification](https://github.com/Tenderly/hardhat-tenderly/tree/master/examples/contract-verification) folder that has examples that work with the new package versions.
